============
ASP.NET Core Routing, Configuration and Dependency Injection
-----------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this workshop is to show how to get begin with ASP.NET Core, starting from empty applications, built from the command line, with the `dotnet new` command.

In the following documents, you will find basic information about the routing engine, how to store configuration in JSON files and about the dependency injection.

[1. Introduction to ASP.NET Core](docs/aspnet-core-introduction.md)

[2. Building the most simple ASP.NET Core application](https://radu-matei.github.io/blog/aspnet-core-startup/)

[3. The Routing Engine](docs/routing.md)

[4. The Configuration Engine](docs/configuration.md)

[5. Using Dependency Injection](docs/configuration-dependency-injection.md)

[6. Inject Dependencies from JSON files](docs/inject-json-dependencies.md)

Most of the documents here originally appeared on [our GitHub Organization repository for ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/microsoft-dx/aspnet-core-fundamentals) and on [my blog](https://radu-matei.github.io/blog/)
